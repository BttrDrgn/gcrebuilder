# GameCube Rebuilder

## Description

GCR is a tool that allows you to edit Nintendo GameCube images.

## Building

GCR can be built via any C# IDE or a CLI command like `msbuild GCRebuilder.sln`

## Original Developer Comments

GCR was written a long time ago and thus have some nasty problems:
- poor overall code quality
- windows-only GUI
- others I just don't remember

I don't think I will have time to do necessary refactoring, bugfixes or improvements.
